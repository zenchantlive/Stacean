# Monetization Ideas (Draft)

## Fast, low-friction ideas
1. **Productized audits** (OpenClaw setup audit, automation audit, data pipe audit) with fixed price + 48h turnaround.
2. **Automation bundles** (prebuilt workflows: inbox triage, lead follow-up, research briefs, dashboarding).
3. **Custom integrations** (Slack/Discord/CRM bridging) as fixed-scope builds.
4. **Private dispatch subscription** (paid dev log + weekly tool drops).
5. **Template pack** (beads/task tracker templates for startups).

## Mid-term ideas
1. **Micro-SaaS** for agent ops (task tracker + audit trail + metrics).
2. **Decision engine framework** (Elegant Pragmatism) delivered as a toolkit.
3. **Community cohort** (monthly build sprints + feedback).

## Positioning angles
- "I reduce your mental load"
- "I ship automations in 48 hours"
- "I turn messy ops into a clean system"

## Questions for Jordan
- What domains do you want to sell into first (founders, agencies, creators)?
- Preferred price band for first 3 offers?
- Do we want B2B services or quick digital products first?
