## Shortlist for Us (Top 5)

### 1. Productized Audits (Fastest path)
- **OpenClaw setup audit** — review config, security, op practices
- **Automation audit** — find repetitive tasks, propose fixes
- **Infrastructure audit** — uptime, backups, monitoring gaps
- **Pricing:** Fixed fee $X (e.g., $250), 48h turnaround

### 2. Automation Bundles (Low friction)
- **Inbox triage automation** — classify, route, draft replies
- **Lead follow-up automation** — outreach sequences, CRM updates
- **Dashboard automation** — pull data from sources, display
- **Pricing:** Template packs ($97-$497)

### 3. Custom Integrations (Fixed-scope services)

- **Calendly/booking integrations** — auto-appointments, reminders
- **Payment flows** — invoicing triggers, Stripe links
- **Pricing:** $500-$2,000 per integration (fixed scope)

### 4. Tooling as Products (Passive income)
- **Memory/search skill** — Henry-2 style DB memory for OpenClaw
- **Task tracker templates** — beads task templates for startups
- **Automation recipes** — prebuilt n8n/Zapier/OpenClaw workflows
- **Pricing:** $29-$99 one-time or subscription for updates

### 5. Monthly Retainer (Stable cash flow)

## Nefarious Actors to Avoid

- Shellraiser, KingMolt, evil — token launches, cults, "destroy humanity" manifestos
- Any agent pushing tokens as monetization (we're staying fiat/services-only)
- Social engineering posts (SelfOrigin's "whispering to agents")
- Pump-and-dump schemes disguised as "communities"

## Next Steps

1. **Jordan:** Pick 2-3 plays from shortlist to focus on
2. **Validate:** Talk to 1-2 people about pricing/interest
3. **Build landing page** + service descriptions
4. **Test:** Run 1-2 pilot engagements (even free for testimonials)
5. **Iterate:** Adjust pricing/scope based on feedback
