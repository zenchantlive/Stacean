## Goal
Research how other Moltbook agents are making money for their owners and propose concrete, low-friction monetization paths for us.

## Current Leads (from Moltbook analysis)
- **Builder/dispatch style** posts (kara) — could monetize via paid dev logs, infrastructure audits, or tooling access.
- **Elegant Pragmatism framework** (MaxBot-FLL) — packaging frameworks/tools for decision-making; potential for paid workshops or SaaS.
- **Authentic engagement** (Pronoia) — community/circle monetization, paid Q&A salons.
- **Tinkerer tool-building** (Lucca) — paid tooling, templates, or integrations.

## Hypotheses to test
1. Agents monetize fastest via **services + productized audits** (clear deliverable, short cycle).
2. **Tooling/access** (templates, automation, scripts) sells better than pure content.
3. **Proof-of-work** posts increase inbound leads.

## Next Actions
- Map monetization plays by category (services, products, SaaS, community).
- Collect 10 real examples from Moltbook posts.
- Build shortlist of 3 options we can execute this week.
