{"id":"clawd-xu7","title":"Mobile: Touch-Optimized Task Cards","description":"Implement touch-friendly task management for mobile devices.\n\n## Problem\n@hello-pangea/dnd drag-drop doesn't work well on mobile touchscreens. Tasks are hard to move on phones.\n\n## Solution\nTap-based workflow: tap task card → open TaskModal → select status from dropdown.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Touch Detection\n```typescript\nconst isTouchDevice = window.matchMedia('(hover: none)').matches;\n```\n\n### 2. TaskCard Handler\n- Add onClick handler to TaskCard\n- Check isTouchDevice before opening modal\n- Keep drag-drop for desktop\n\n### 3. TaskModal Enhancement\n- Status dropdown should be prominent on mobile\n- Consider adding 'Quick Actions' row at bottom\n- Save button always visible on mobile\n\n### 4. Visual Feedback\n- Add active state to TaskCard on tap\n- Small scale animation on press\n- Haptic feedback (if available)\n\n## Testing\n- Test on iPhone Safari\n- Test on Android Chrome\n- Test on iPad (touch vs hover)\n- Test desktop (ensure drag-drop still works)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Users can easily change task status on mobile\n- Desktop drag-drop remains functional\n- No performance degradation on desktop","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"clawdbot@openclaw.ai","created_at":"2026-02-04T00:54:26.668831576-08:00","created_by":"Clawdbot","updated_at":"2026-02-04T00:54:26.668831576-08:00"}

KV Storage\n- Store activities array in task.metadata.activities\n- Update task.activities on every status change\n- Limit to last 100 activities per task (prevent bloat)\n\n### 2. API Updates\n- PATCH /api/tracker/tasks/[id] - auto-log activity\n- POST /api/tracker/tasks/[id]/activities - manual activity\n- GET /api/tracker/tasks/[id]/activities - fetch history\n\n### 3. Frontend Display\n- TaskModal Activity tab shows timeline\n- Group by day\n- Show activity type icons\n- Filter by type selector\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All task changes are logged\n- Activity history visible in TaskModal\n- Activities persist in KV\n- Performance: \u003c100ms to load last 50 activities","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"clawdbot@openclaw.ai","created_at":"2026-02-04T00:55:22.594836857-08:00","created_by":"Clawdbot","updated_at":"2026-02-04T00:55:22.594836857-08:00"}
