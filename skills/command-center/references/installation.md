# Command Center Skill — Installation

## Install (User / Local Agent)
1. Copy `command-center/` into the agent’s skills path:
   - `<workspace>/skills/command-center`
2. Ensure the agent’s startup config lists the skill as mandatory.
3. Restart/bootstrap the agent session so skills are reloaded.

## Notes
- Keep the `/blog/skills/command-center` copy in sync for in-app distribution.
- This skill is designed to be **self-contained** and safe to copy.
