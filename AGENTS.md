# Agent Instructions

## ALWAYS READ THIS FIRST

**Before starting any work, read the `use-skill` skill.** This is your single source of truth for all available skills and when to use them. It auto-discovers new skills as they're added.

```bash
# Scan all available skills
bash skills/use-skill/scripts/scan-skills.sh
```

## MANDATORY: Always Use Agent Swarm Workflow

**FOR EVERY TASK, ALWAYS USE THE `agent-swarm-workflow` SKILL.**

This is not optional. Do not use `coding-agent` or other single-agent approaches. The swarm workflow is the default and only method for all work.

### Why
- Parallel execution via multiple agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini)
- Self-coordinating through Agent Mail and Beads
- Distributed, robust, and self-organizing
- Quality loops until code is solid

### How
1. Read `skills/agent-swarm-workflow/SKILL.md` **every time** before starting work
2. Use the **EXACT prompts** specified in that skill
3. Spawn agents via NTM: `ntm spawn <project> --cc=3 --cod=2`
4. Let agents self-coordinate via Agent Mail and BV
5. Run quality loops (self-review → cross-review → random exploration) until clean

### Never
- Use single-agent coding tools directly
- Skip the swarm workflow for "small" tasks
- Deviate from the prompts in the skill file

**When in doubt: read the skill file again. It has all the exact prompts and procedures.**

## Project Tracking

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Sending Media via WhatsApp

When sending screenshots or images to the user:

```bash
# Method: Use message tool with filePath parameter
message action=send target=+15306354284 filePath=/path/to/image.png

# Example with agent-browser screenshot:
agent-browser open http://localhost:8765/mail
agent-browser screenshot /tmp/agent-mail.png
agent-browser close
message action=send target=+15306354284 filePath=/tmp/agent-mail.png
```

**Note:** The `media` parameter with file:// URLs doesn't work. Use `filePath` parameter instead.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
bd list --status=open # All open issues
bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id> --reason="Completed"
bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
bd sync               # Commit and push changes
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
bd sync                 # Commit beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit code
bd sync                 # Commit any new beads changes
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `bd sync` before ending session
